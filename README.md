Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in
digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals
with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or
cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a
lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.
