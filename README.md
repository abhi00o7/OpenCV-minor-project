# Introduction

Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in
digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals
with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or
cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a
lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

# Installation
OpenCV-Python supports all the leading platforms like Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. It can
be installed in either of the following ways:
* 1. From pre-built binaries and source:
OpenCV can be easily downloaded from the website.
* 2. Unofficial pre-built OpenCV packages for Python.
Packages for standard desktop environments (Windows, macOS, almost any GNU/Linux
distribution)
 - run pip install opencv-python #if you need only main modules
 - run pip install opencv-contrib-python #if you need both main and contrib modules
(check extra modules listing from OpenCV documentation)
You can either use Jupyter notebooks or any Python IDE of your choice for writing the
scripts.
