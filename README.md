# OpenCV Face Detection and Recognition

## OpenCV-minor-project

>Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in
digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals
with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or
cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a
lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

## Installation
>OpenCV-Python supports all the leading platforms like Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. It can
be installed in either of the following ways:
1. From pre-built binaries and source:
OpenCV can be easily downloaded from the website.
2. Unofficial pre-built OpenCV packages for Python.
Packages for standard desktop environments (Windows, macOS, almost any GNU/Linux
distribution)
``` 
 - run 'pip install opencv-python' #if you need only main modules
 - run 'pip install opencv-contrib-python' #if you need both main and contrib modules
 - run 'pip install numpy' #libraries needed for facial recognition
``` 
>(check extra modules listing from OpenCV documentation)
>You can either use Jupyter notebooks or any Python IDE of your choice for writing the
scripts.

## Document Purpose 
>The purpose the document is to ensure the working of the project, the project currently works on the version 1.0

## Product Scope
>The scope of our project is versatile as there are numerous application of face detection and recognotion. This project is just a sutle demonstraion of few of the vast possibilities of open computer vision

## Intended Audience and Document Overview
>Program is created for users who are begginers in programming to introduce them with different possibilities of using open computer vision and python for creative purposes.
_Currently the software is running on version 1.0 and in the coming time our team will release the update._

## Product Overview
>It is a python script to demonstrate usages of OpenCV to beginners.

## Product Functionality 
>*v1.0* can detect multiple faces from an image and live video feed.

## Design and Implementation Constraints
>It is written in python v3.7.
with using the following imports ```import cv2 import numpy import os```

# Specific Requirements

## User Interfaces
>needs python v3.7 and packages ```cv2``` & ```numpy```

## Hardware Interfaces
>It needs a computer or a smartphone running python v3.7 or any other device with python and dependencies installed.
*webcam is necessary

# Execution
> *Follow the steps below* 
* download or clone the repo to you git desktop or explorer
* open ```faceDetection.py```  file 
* edit the path for haar cascades
* open ternimal type ```python .\FaceDetection.py\```
